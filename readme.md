# What The French

An app built as a capstone project from my learnings from my bootcamp. Ultimately, a project for those who know a bit of French and are interested in quizzing themselves or want to listen to French podcasts.

## Motivation

Have you been practicing French for a while and just can't remember which verb and tense to use? Yeah, me neither. That's why I wanted to create What The French to help me practice and hopefully get 100% on one of the quizzes I created. If you're not interested in practicing your verb conjugation, you can listen to French podcasts instead.

## Technologies Used

- Python3
- Flask
- PostgresSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- JavaScript
- Jinja
- Bootstrap
- CSS

## How to use What The French

You can do two things on What The French: quiz yourself on verb conjugation and listen to french podcasts. In order to have access to the quiz section, you must create an account and login. Once you've taken a quiz, your scores will be listed in your Account section. Don't worry, you can take any given quiz as many times you'd like! If you are only interested in listening to podcasts, you don't need to create an account - you can start listening right away.
