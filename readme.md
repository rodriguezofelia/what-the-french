# What The French

Have you been practing French for a while and just can't remember which verb and tense to use? Yeah, me either. That's why I wanted to create What The French to help me practice and hopefully get 100% on one of the quizzes I created myself. If you're not interested in practicing your verb conjugation, you can listen to French podcasts instead.
